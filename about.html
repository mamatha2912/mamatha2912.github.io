            <h2> YOGA </h2>
            <p>
                The word 'Yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', meaning 'to join' or 'to yoke' or 'to unite'. As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature.
                Yoga is gentle way to improve your posture, balance and coordination. Yoga is a systematic practice of physical excessive, breath control, relaxation, diet control, and positive thinking and 
                meditation aimed at developing harmony in the body, mind, and environment.It brings together physical and mental disciplines to achieve a peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety and keeps you relaxing. It also helps in increasing flexibility, muscle strength and body tone.

            <h2>Yoga during Quarantine</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best forms of physical, mental and spiritual practice, Yoga is best suited for this quarantine period. “Practice of yoga takes care of all these mental issues. Yoga along with breathing and meditation can be considered as an all-round exercise which will take care of our body, mind and soul. Hatha yoga practices are best suited for beginners. These practices also can have different variations which can make one perfect in the final poses. Some of these practices include Tadasana, Trikonasana, Ardha Kati Chakrasana and Veerbadrasana,” and Yog Nidra is the most beneficial during these times.“One of the most profound and powerful techniques that can be used is Yog Nidra. 20 minutes of Yog Nidra every day can help immensely in overcoming stress and anxiety.”
                The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home  and sitting down more than we usually do. It’s hard for a lot of us to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people who don’t usually do a lot of physical exercise.
                But at a time like this, it’s very important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as possible. WHO’s Be Active campaign aims to help all of us to do just that - and to have some fun at the same time.
                Remember - Just taking a short break from sitting, by doing 3-4 minutes of light intensity physical movement, such as walking or stretching, will help ease your muscles and improve blood circulation and muscle activity.
                Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers - all conditions that can increase susceptibility to COVID-19.
                It also improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent falls and injuries.
                Regular physical activity can help give our days a routine and be a way to stay in contact with family and friends. It’s also good for our mental health - reducing the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of dementia - and improve overall feelings

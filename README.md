Welcome mamatha2912
Your Project's Name : ONLINE YOGA CLASSES

 2020 will be a milestone year for generations ahead and the reason is Corona virus due to which the restricted travel, panic over the risk of infection, 
 continuous flow of negative news and scarcity of day-to-day material and resources due the corona pandemic are all adding to growing anxiety. 
 Being confined to our homes can be mentally challenging. Besides staying connected to family and friends, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, 
 there is also one other thing that can help keep anxiety and mental health in check - yoga. Yoga has known to be beneficial since ages, and not just for weight loss, 
 but also to keep the mind calm.
